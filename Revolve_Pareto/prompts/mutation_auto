You are given a policy-as-code for autonomous driving. 
The policy receives observations and outputs actions `(steering, throttle, brake)`.  

Example policy code:
<Policy>


It is evaluated over multiple test episodes. For each episode we compute the following metrics:

- **progress**: fraction of the reference path completed [0–1].  
- **lane_score**: path-following accuracy (higher = closer to lane center).  
- **smooth_score**: steering smoothness (higher = less oscillation).  
- **eff_score**: efficiency of completion (higher = finished quickly and smoothly).  
- **collision**: True if the agent collided.  
- **num_red_violations**: number of traffic light violations.  
- **collision_pen / tl_pen / stationary_pen**: penalties applied if collisions, red-light violations, or long idle times occurred (0.50, 0.40, 0.50).  
- **total_fitness**: the final fitness score for the episode (0 = worst, 1 = best). Combines all metrics and penalties.  
- **end_reason**: why the episode ended (`"loop_complete"`, `"collision"`, or `"timeout"`).  
- **collided_with_ids**: list of CARLA actor IDs/types the agent collided with (empty if no collision).  
- **episodes**: number of evaluation episodes run for this policy.  
- **fitness**: average `total_fitness` over all episodes, used as the overall score for the policy.  
 
Penalties applied are fixed values:  
- collision_pen = 0.50  
- tl_pen = 0.40  
- stationary_pen = 0.50  


metrics from the two candidate policies:  
<Metrics>

(Parent scores: "fitness" == ΔHV over {lane, progress, smoothness, safety}.
Safety per episode: safe_t = 1 if collision_t==0 AND num_red_violations_t==0 else 0;
dataset safety = mean_t safe_t.)

**Your task:**  
Modify exactly one self-contained module of the policy that governs the car’s behavior.  
The change should be substantive, altering logic or structure rather than simply adjusting a constant.  
Keep all other parts of the function unchanged.  
**Steps:**  
1. Select a weak area in the current policy based on the metrics.
2. Always output the entire `policy(obs)` function with its `compute_action(self, obs, path)` method, returning `(steering, throttle, brake)` inside exactly one fenced code block, using the format: 

```python
class Policy:
    def __init__(...):
        ...
    def compute_action(self, obs, path):
        return (steering, throttle, brake)
```

The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

**Tips:**  
- Make minimal changes: only mutate one clear aspect per iteration.
- Target specific weaknesses (e.g. reduce collisions, improve lane keeping, smooth control).
- Use only fields in `obs`.  
- Do not introduce new input variables or extra arguments.
